/// CISC 496 - Group P1 - Project: Eye Say
/// Description: Example win condition
/// How to use:
///     Attach this script to an 'Empty' object in the game world
///     Attach the Crystal object to the script as goalPost
///     Each level will require their own "Win Condition" script
///     The Win condition, once met should activate the Crystal,
///         and deactivated if the level has such conditions
///     The Update() function should keep track of whether the objective is met
///
///     Completion of the actual level requires touching the active crystal
///         See playerController.cs or details
///         
///     The example below:
///         The 'objective' is a desctrubile object
///             Keeps checking if the object has been destroyed
///             activats crystal once destroyed
///
